"""
üìÑ TEMPLATE CONFIG FILE

This is a template file for sensitive configuration values like database credentials and Django's secret key.

‚û°Ô∏è INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.**
2. Copy this file and rename the copy to `config.py`.
3. Fill in the values in `config.py` with your local or production-specific credentials.
4. Keep `config.py` in the same directory as `settings.py`.
5. Ensure `config.py` is listed in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed to version control.

This pattern helps keep your credentials secure and your repository clean.
